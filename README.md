#ABOUT TASK PROJECT
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of speech-to-text conversion using Python’s speech_recognition library. The main objective of this project is to convert spoken words into written text in real-time using the system’s microphone and Google’s Web Speech API. This simple yet powerful solution highlights the integration of human voice input into modern software systems, paving the way for voice-enabled applications.

The program begins by importing the speech_recognition module and initializing the Recognizer class. The Recognizer object serves as the core interface for all speech recognition tasks in the script.Next, the microphone is set as the input source using the Microphone() class within a with block. This ensures that the microphone stream is automatically opened and closed at the right time, optimizing system resource usage.

After recording the audio, the program attempts to convert it into text using recognize_google(), which connects to Google’s Web Speech API. This API takes the audio input and returns a text string, which the program then prints on the screen.
